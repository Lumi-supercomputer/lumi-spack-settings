# Spack configuration files for LUMI

Repository containing configuration files for the Spack instances installed in `/appl/lumi/spack` on LUMI for public use. The files in this repository can be found in `/appl/lumi/spack/etc/` on LUMI. The folder hierarchy is determined by the Cray Programming Environment (CPE) version and Spack release version. For example, the directory

    22.08/0.18.1/
    22.08/0.18.1-user/

contains the configuration files for Spack version 0.18.1 configured to use CPE 22.08. The first instance `0.18.1` is the upstream instance, which is maintained by the LUMI Support Team. The second instance `0.18.1-user` is a separate instance configured to install packages in a user-defined directory in e.g. `/project/`. It is chained to the upstream instance, so that already installed packages can be reused.

If you are user of LUMI, and want to set up your own instance, you can copy the `compilers.yaml`and  `packages.yaml` files to your instance. The `config.yaml` needs to be modified if you want to use that one.
